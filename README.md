```
P.S. We had some further issues with the development and shopping cart functionality is down at the moment.
Thank You and do enjoy Christmas for now :)

### Live demo of the application: https://iot-eshop.herokuapp.com/
 
### Accounts:

1 Gmail - We created a company email on https://www.google.com/gmail
        
2 Database - We created an account on https://cloud.mongodb.com/ (Cloud) for this app
           
3 Deployoment - We created an account on https://dashboard.heroku.com/ 

### Project keys:
> For local development download git repository, navigate to the downloaded folder and open it with any IDE, run **npm install** command inside a terminal within that document. After that in iot-e-shop/config folder add a new file called **keys_dev.js** and add the following code:
```
// DEVELOPER API keys,Usualy we wont upload this keys to the repository, and will only be available for few days here
module.exports = {
   MongoURI: '',
   googleClientID: '',
   googleClientSecret: '',
   facebookClientID: '',
   facebookClientSecret: '',
   gmailPassword: ''
}

```
> Add youre own conection strings on the code above and after that run **npm run dev** inside the terminal than open the application on http://localhost:5000/

### Internet of Things ???


> In essence, the **[Internet of Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlhmzVL5bm8)** means that “dumb” devices (e.g., a lightbulb) become “smart” when the lightbulb can be remotely controlled and/or able to exchange data with production, operator or other connected devices. 
>
> The Internet of Things is a hot word in technology industry right now, it promises to change the way we live our lives, and as the word travels from mouth to mouth, IoT devices get more and more adopted. The number of devices is expected to reach 50 billion by the end of 2020 and reach 1 trillion by the end of year 2035.
>
> The market economic potential is of $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year which, will be equivalent to 11% of the world economy. It will certainly change how businesses function and impact competitive forces in different industries and a major part of the created IoT devices are for consumer use, e.g. home automation, connected vehicles, wearable technology, appliances etc.
>

# Project Proposal:

> The aim of our project is to create a web application to act as a marketplace **just for IoT Devices**. Our application will provide the tools necessary for any IoT manufacturer to sell their products, and help the customer discover the full spectrum of IoT Devices. We want to filter the IoT products from the massive pool of "dumb" products.
>
> Application will be accessible worldwide, will facilitate 3rd party shipments, selling/buying functionality, and most important to help customers **discover new products**.

# We Use: 

### 1. Project Management:
> [`Agile Methodology`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9QbYZh1YXY) is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.
>
> [`SCRUM`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vt7Ik8Ublw) is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.
>
> [`Trello`](https://trello.com/en) is a team collaboration tool which enable you to organize and priotirize projects in a flexible way
>


### 2. Version Control:
> [`GitHub`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
>
> [`GitFlow`](https://youtu.be/aJnFGMclhU8?t=199) is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It has attracted a lot of attention because it is very well suited to collaboration and scaling the development team.


[![Watch the video](GitFlow.gif)](https://youtu.be/aJnFGMclhU8?t=199)

### 3. Technologies:
> [`JavaScript`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nItSSTwBvSU) often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
>
> [`Node.js`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gQG4cFjahw) is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
>
> [`Express.js`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjXAr5CJ2Ec) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.
>
> [`RESTful API`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA) is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. ... REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage.
>
> [`MongoDB`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvIr-2lMLsk) is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.

### 4. Application Architecture:
> [`MVC`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I) stands for "Model-View-Controller." MVC is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input).
>

### 5. Application Deployment:
> [`Heroku - Cloud Application Platform`](https://www.heroku.com/) Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
