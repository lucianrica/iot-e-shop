      <h3>Why become a seller</h3>
      <p>
         About 50 percent of sales on IoT eShop are made through third-party sellers. You could take a slice of that pie and
         make your own five or six-figure income as an IoT entrepreneur.
         <br>
         As far as how to market your products â€” there are a lot of examples of profitable online
         businesses to follow.
